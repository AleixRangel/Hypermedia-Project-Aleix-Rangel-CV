Curriculum Web Project

1. Project analysis, User Profile:
	
	The final users of my project could be, technology companies whera I'm looking for a job, 
	internship recruiters from a company, to university professors. This are some of the final
	users that I can find doing this project, this is due to that the project goes about doing
	a CV.
	
	These users will be interested in finding clear and well-structured personal information such as:
	Academic background, Sports experience and personal values, Languages ​​and skills,
	and a way to contact me, among others.

2. Project analysis, Information architecture: 
	
	The structure I have decided to use to create my curriculum vitae is the following one:

	First of all, I have put my first and last name on the left side of the header, under my name I've put my current professional status.
	On the right side of it I have placed my main contact information, such as phone number, email address, and location.

	Right under the header, I've put a short description of what I'm currently doing, briefly explaining that I am a student and 
	a high-performance athlete. This gives the viewer a quick understanding of who I am in just a few lines.
	
	Below this introductory section, I structured the rest of the content into different blocks in order to keep the information clear and 
	easy to follow. The first section is a Personal Profile, where I describe my background, mindset, and professional goals.
	
	After that, I included the Education section, saying my actual studys and the cursed before. This section is placed near the top since, 
	as a student with no work experience, my academic background is one of the most relevant elements.
	
	Then comes my Sports Experience section, highlighting my role as a high-level rower, my participation in national and international competitions, 
	and the personal and professional skills I have developed through elite sports.
	
	Following that, I added a Languages section, where I list the languages I speak and my proficiency level.
	
	Finally, I included the Skills section, where I present my soft skills, represented as short tags.
		
3. Project analysis, Visual design:

	For the visual design of my curriculum vitae, I chose a clean and minimalist style in order to communicate professionalism and clarity. 
	Since this is a personal CV aimed at academic and early-career opportunities, I wanted to ensure that the layout felt modern, 
	simple to navigate, and easy to read.
	
	Regarding the color palette, I selected neutral tones such as white and soft gray as the base, combined with a dark green for highlights and section titles. 
	The green adds personality to the document while still maintaining a formal and balanced appearance. This color helps guide the reader’s 
	attention to key areas without distracting from the content.
	
	For typography, I opted for a Verdana,Arial, serif font that offers high readability on screens and printed formats. The text hierarchy is created through font size, 
	weight, and spacing rather than decorative elements.
	
	The page layout is vertically structured, placing the most essential information at the top so that the reader can quickly understand who I am and what I do.
	Sections are separated with clear titles and spacing to make navigation intuitive.
	
	To develop my visual style, I looked at modern CV examples and professional portfolio designs online. I've also taken the CV form the practics
	sessions to have an inspiration for the project.
